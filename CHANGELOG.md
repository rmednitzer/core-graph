# Changelog

All notable changes to core-graph are documented here.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and this project adheres to semantic versioning of the schema and ontology
contracts. Migrations are forward-only — see `schema/migrations/README.md`.

## Unreleased

### Phase 0 — verify and fix latent bugs

* `schema/migrations/020_temporal_invariants.sql`: replaced invalid
  `ADD CONSTRAINT IF NOT EXISTS` syntax with `pg_constraint` catalog lookups
  inside `DO` blocks; added explicit backfill (`UPDATE ... WHERE ... IS NULL`)
  before promoting `mutation_actor`, `mutation_reason`, and `source` to
  `NOT NULL` so the migration is safe on tables that already contain rows.
* `schema/migrations/011_vector_dimensions.sql`: silent `TRUNCATE` is no
  longer permitted. The migration now refuses unless the operator has set
  `app.allow_embedding_truncate=true` (transaction-local). Documented the
  flag in `docs/operations/database-migration-runbook.md`.
* `api/mcp/skills/queries/asset_security_events.cypher` and
  `identity_audit_trail.cypher`: removed AGE-incompatible `+` string
  concatenation. The time threshold is now computed Python-side and bound
  as the `time_threshold` parameter (ISO-8601 string).
* `api/mcp/tools/identity_attribution.py`: writer now widens the caller's
  session compartments to include `investigation_id` before the INSERT,
  closing the write-then-read RLS visibility gap on TLP:RED edges.
* `policies/resource/threat_entity.yaml`: TLP comparisons converted from
  string `tlp_marking in [...]` to integer `tlp_level <= N`, aligning with
  the schema/RLS encoding `0..4`. Cerbos test fixtures updated.
* `api/db.py`: `statement_timeout` is now set uniformly inside
  `get_connection` from `age_query_guard.query_timeout_ms`. Removes the
  per-call override in `cypher_query.py` so REST, MCP, ingest, and TAXII
  paths all enforce the same per-role ceiling.

### Tests added

* `tests/test_cypher_template_safety.py` — static scan rejecting `+` string
  concatenation in any `*.cypher` template.
* `tests/test_threat_entity_policy_tlp.py` — rejects string TLP tokens in
  Cerbos resource policies.
* `tests/test_identity_attribution_compartments.py` — exercises the
  `_widen_compartments` helper.
* `tests/test_migration_020_safety.py` — parses 020 to assert the bug
  patterns are gone.
* `tests/test_migration_011_truncate_guard.py` — asserts the GUC guard.
* `tests/test_statement_timeout_uniformity.py` — rejects duplicated
  `statement_timeout` writes outside `api/db.py`.
